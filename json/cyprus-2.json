      "The economy of Cyprus is based on a free enterprise system very similar to that of the United Kingdom. A company limited by shares is incorporated under the Cyprus Companies Law, Chap. 113, which is based on the 1948 British Companies Act. Due to its numerous treaties and tax benefits (dividends, royalties, etc.), Cyprus is also a jurisdiction widely used for foreign investment and finance. Some of the most common activities of legal entities in Cyprus include holding-type structures, as well as international trade and other vehicles.",
