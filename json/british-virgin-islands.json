      "The Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 contemplates that custodian and management services are required to be licensed under this Act; the Mutual Funds Regulations, 2010 also specify that private and professional funds must, at all times, have a fund manager, an administrator and a custodian. These requirements in the Law have the purpose of ensuring the protection and proper management of client assets.",

Therefore, it has issued the present guidelines based on the provisions in the Regulations for a private fund and a professional fund to be exempted from the mandatory appointment of a custodian or fund manager. In order to obtain this exemption, a request must be submitted to the BVI Financial Securities Commission in writing.",
